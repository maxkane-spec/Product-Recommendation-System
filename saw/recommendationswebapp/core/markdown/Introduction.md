## Hello **{UserDisplayName}**,
## Welcome to the deployment of Recommendations Service

We just created a new resource group called **{ResourceGroup.Name}** in the **{Location}** region under your subscription with id **{SubscriptionId}**.

In order to get the service up and running, the following resources will be deployed:
1. An [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/) to host the recommendations service 
2. An [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/?v=16.50) account to store model data 
3. An [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/) app to collect traces and telemetry 

In the next screens, you will be asked to select options for each of the above resources.
